    # 1. Copy/paste the problem definition. Read it out loud and understand what they want.
        You are given an array of strings tokens that represents an arithmetic expression in a Reverse Polish Notation.

        Evaluate the expression. Return an integer that represents the value of the expression.

        Note that:

            The valid operators are '+', '-', '*', and '/'.
            Each operand may be an integer or another expression.
            The division between two integers always truncates toward zero.
            There will not be any division by zero.
            The input represents a valid arithmetic expression in a reverse polish notation.
            The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.

    # 2. Look at the examples they give you for what the algorithm should do. "Solution(input) -> output". Come up with 1 or 2 examples on your own, and write them down.

    # 3. Think out loud, and write down (!!) the possible high-level approaches to solving the problem. 
    #     Eg: "this two-sum problem can be brute-forced in O(n^2) time using two for-loops, or it can be solved in O(n) using a hashmap." 
    #     This doesn't have to be detailed, just a possible approach. Think about possible edge cases and how they could break the solution.

    #     Here, if you are completely blanking after 5 minutes, and can't even do a brute-force solution, then do what the OP said 
    #     - abort mission, and spend the next hour understanding the problem by looking at the solution. Once you understood the solution go to step 4.

    # 4. Pick one of the approaches, and write out the pseudo code for it, while taking out loud as to what your thought process is.

    # 5. CODE THE ACTUAL SOLUTION. If you actually followed steps 1-4, this part is going to be trivial. You will bang out the actual code often in under 5 minutes. 
    # Paste the code into leetcode (or whatever platform you are using) to ensure it works. You can even write your own test cases, and run locally.

    # 6. If you haven't addressed this in step 3 (when you were talking about approaches), think about how you would optimize the solution. Talk about big O here.
