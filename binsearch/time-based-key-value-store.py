    # 1. Copy/paste the problem definition. Read it out loud and understand what they want.
        Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

        Implement the TimeMap class:

            TimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure.
            void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key key with the value value at the given time timestamp.
            String get(String key, int timestamp) Returns a value such that set was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are no values, it returns "".

    # 2. Look at the examples they give you for what the algorithm should do. "Solution(input) -> output". Come up with 1 or 2 examples on your own, and write them down.

    # 3. Think out loud, and write down (!!) the possible high-level approaches to solving the problem. 
    #     Eg: "this two-sum problem can be brute-forced in O(n^2) time using two for-loops, or it can be solved in O(n) using a hashmap." 
    #     This doesn't have to be detailed, just a possible approach. Think about possible edge cases and how they could break the solution.

    #     Here, if you are completely blanking after 5 minutes, and can't even do a brute-force solution, then do what the OP said 
    #     - abort mission, and spend the next hour understanding the problem by looking at the solution. Once you understood the solution go to step 4.

    # 4. Pick one of the approaches, and write out the pseudo code for it, while taking out loud as to what your thought process is.

    # 5. CODE THE ACTUAL SOLUTION. If you actually followed steps 1-4, this part is going to be trivial. You will bang out the actual code often in under 5 minutes. 
    # Paste the code into leetcode (or whatever platform you are using) to ensure it works. You can even write your own test cases, and run locally.

    # 6. If you haven't addressed this in step 3 (when you were talking about approaches), think about how you would optimize the solution. Talk about big O here.
